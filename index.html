  <h2>Chapter 1 — Sunlight in Her Hair</h2>
  <p>
    Krystal Hale woke up to sunlight spilling through her bedroom window. The golden light brushed her hair and warmed her desk. She stretched and let her fingers trace the edges of her notebook, where tiny doodles and notes from yesterday still sat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside, the city was waking up. Birds called softly, cars hummed in the distance, and the faint scent of flowers drifted through her slightly open window. Most people would have rushed out of bed, but Krystal liked mornings like this—slow, calm, full of small things most people never noticed.
  </p>
  <p>
    From downstairs, she could hear her dad humming slightly off-key. The gentle clink of cups and the hiss of the kettle added a soft rhythm. Her mother’s voice called a playful warning to him about burning the toast again.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Morning, Krystal! Come see if you can beat me in a race today!” her dad called up the stairs.<br>
    Krystal laughed. “You’re going down, Dad. Don’t even try to cheat this time!”
  </p>
  <p>
    She swung her legs over the bed and padded barefoot across the wooden floor. Her lavender-scented blanket smelled faintly sweet, and for a moment, she paused to enjoy the quiet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Downstairs, her parents were already moving around the kitchen. Her dad waved at her with a grin. “Ready to lose?” he teased.<br>
    “Not a chance,” Krystal replied, smiling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The three of them stepped outside. The gravel crunched under their shoes, and the morning air felt crisp. Her dad ran ahead, arms pumping, laughing like a child, while her mom walked behind, smiling at them both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Krystal noticed small things—the way sunlight glinted off a windowpane, the curve of a leaf on the sidewalk, how a breeze made her dad’s hair stick up in funny angles. Ordinary things, but they made her feel alive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her mother reached out and squeezed her hand. “Enjoy it, honey. Don’t rush too fast.”<br>
    Krystal nodded. “I’m trying.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The walk felt like a little bubble where everything was safe. For a few minutes, she forgot school, forgot drifting friends, even forgot the quiet ache in her chest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Back home, the afternoon passed quietly. Krystal unpacked her school bag, lining up her notebooks on the desk. A flicker of movement caught the corner of her eye. She turned. Nothing. Probably just a shadow. She shook her head. “Nothing to worry about,” she whispered. But the unease lingered.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, lying in bed, Krystal stared at the street outside her window. The house was silent except for the soft ticking of the clock. And then—just for a second—she thought she saw a shadow moving across the yard. Not like a person walking, more like it was hovering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her heart skipped. She blinked. Nothing. She hugged her pillow and tried to calm herself. “Probably just my imagination,” she told herself. But somewhere deep down, a tiny voice whispered: Something is out there. Waiting. Krystal didn’t know it yet, but this was only the beginning.
  </p>

<div class="page" id="ch2">
  <h2>Chapter 2 — Moonlight Vanilla</h2>
  <p>
    Krystal Hale sat at the dinner table, her fingers tracing the edge of her plate. The day at school had felt heavier than usual. Mia and Rowan, her best friends, had barely spoken to her, their laughter echoing somewhere just out of reach. She pushed the thought aside, trying to focus on her parents’ voices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her father poured tea into their mugs, humming a tune that made her smile despite herself. “How was your day, sunshine?” he asked, looking at her with a soft grin.<br>
    Krystal shrugged. “It was fine. Just… school stuff.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Her mother glanced up from her plate, smiling gently. “Well, we’re glad you’re home now.” The three of them ate in a quiet rhythm, exchanging small talk about chores, the weather, and plans for the weekend. Krystal tried to absorb it all—the warmth, the safety, the ordinary magic of being together.
  </p>
  <p>
    After dinner, her mother went to her room to relax. Krystal stayed at the table, idly stirring her tea. Her dad leaned back in his chair, a mischievous glint in his eye. “I have a surprise for you,” he said quietly.<br>
    Krystal raised an eyebrow. “Now? Mom said no going out for a week.”<br>
    “I know,” he said, glancing toward the bedroom. “But some moments are too important to wait for rules.”<br>
    He held out his hand. “Trust me?”<br>
    Krystal hesitated, then nodded. She grabbed his hand, and they slipped quietly out the door, careful not to wake her mother. The night air was cool and carried the faint scent of flowers from the garden. Street lamps cast soft circles of light, making the city feel calm, like it belonged to them alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    They reached a small ice cream shop tucked in the corner of the street. Its warm light spilled onto the sidewalk. Krystal’s eyes widened. “Moonlight Vanilla!” she whispered, recognizing her favorite flavor.<br>
    Her father smiled. “Yours tonight, kiddo.” The first bite melted on her tongue. Sweet, creamy, just a hint of magic. The tension in her chest eased, and she let herself laugh, the sound bright and unburdened.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’ve missed this… us,” she said softly.<br>
    “I’ve missed you too,” he replied, ruffling her hair. “Even when life feels heavy, these little moments matter. You matter.”
  </p>
  <p>
    They sat on a small bench outside the shop, sharing ice cream and stories, letting the world fade around them. For a little while, the ache of drifting friends and growing loneliness melted into the night air.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they walked back home, the streets seemed calmer, quieter. Krystal’s thoughts wandered to her world outside—the crowded hallways of school, the friends she felt slipping away—but tonight, it didn’t matter. Tonight was about the warmth of her family, about laughter shared under the soft glow of street lamps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, as she lay in bed, the house quiet around her, she thought she saw a shadow move past her window. Just for a second. Blinking, she told herself it was nothing. Probably just the wind. But a small shiver tickled her spine. Something was watching. Something was waiting.
  </p>

<div class="page" id="ch3">
  <h2>Chapter 3 — Little Shadows in a Sunny House</h2>
  <p>
    Krystal walked through the school hallways, keeping her head down. The noise of chatter, laughter, and lockers slamming felt like it belonged to someone else. She tried not to be noticed. She didn’t want to answer questions, didn’t want to explain herself.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the far end of the corridor, Mia and Rowan laughed with a group of friends. Krystal waved, but they didn’t even look. Lately, it felt like they were slipping away, like she existed on the edge of their world. She swallowed hard and kept walking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lunch was no better. Krystal found a quiet spot under the big oak tree in the courtyard. She opened her notebook and doodled absentmindedly, letting her pen move over the pages. Around her, other students joked and ate together, full of energy. Krystal remembered when she used to be part of that. Now, she felt invisible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even in class, she tried to participate. She raised her hand, spoke up once or twice, but the teacher’s praise seemed to land on everyone else. She sat back, quiet, feeling like a shadow in the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time school ended, Krystal felt drained. She kept her eyes on the ground as she walked home. Everything seemed heavier than usual—her backpack, her thoughts, her chest. She felt small, almost like she was fading out of her own life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Home offered a brief relief. The house smelled of her mother’s cooking, warm and familiar. Her dad hummed in the kitchen, trying to lighten the mood, but Krystal couldn’t shake the feeling of being alone in a crowd.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, lying in bed, she stared at the street outside her window. Everything looked normal, calm. But then—just for a second—she saw a shadow move. Blinking, she told herself it was nothing. But the unease didn’t go away. Something felt…different. Like her world was starting to change, even if she didn’t understand how yet.
  </p>

<div class="page" id="ch4">
  <h2>Chapter 4 — The Beginning of the Storm</h2>
  <p>
    Krystal had started noticing small things that didn’t fit. Her dad, usually cheerful in the mornings, seemed distracted. He would sit at the kitchen table, staring at his coffee for long minutes without drinking it. Sometimes he muttered to himself or glanced toward the window as if expecting something—or someone.
  </p>
  <p>
    At school, her friends kept drifting farther away. Mia and Rowan had their own groups now. Krystal tried joining their conversations, but her words seemed to vanish into the air. It was like she was fading from everyone’s world, except her parents’.
  </p>
  <p>
    Back home, the tension was quiet but growing. Her dad’s phone buzzed constantly, and he would sometimes step outside to take calls she wasn’t supposed to hear. At night, she could hear low, indistinct voices through the walls. Enough to make her stomach twist.
  </p>
  <p>
    One evening, Krystal found him by the window, staring out into the street. “Dad?” she asked softly. He turned, forcing a smile. “I’m fine, Krystal. Just… thinking.” But she knew he wasn’t. His eyes held a shadow she hadn’t seen before. A worry that didn’t belong.
  </p>
  <p>
    Letters started arriving in the mailbox. Strange letters, typed in unusual fonts, with warnings she couldn’t understand. Some days, Krystal noticed people outside staring at their house before vanishing into the crowd. Her dad noticed too but never said much.
  </p>
  <p>
    Krystal tried to focus on normal things—homework, chores, small routines. But deep down, she felt the world changing around her.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of the week, she couldn’t ignore it anymore. Something was coming. Something dangerous. And she had a feeling that nothing would ever be the same again.

    The morning started like any other. Krystal woke to sunlight spilling through her window, but something felt off. She expected the usual sounds—the hum of her father in the kitchen, her mother moving around, the gentle warmth of home.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when she walked downstairs, the kitchen was quiet. Her dad’s chair was empty. His coffee mug sat untouched. The smell of toast lingered, but no one was there. “Dad?” Krystal called, her voice catching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her mother appeared in the doorway, face pale and trembling. “He… he didn’t come home last night,” she said quietly. “We don’t know where he is.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Krystal’s chest tightened. Her dad—the one person who always made her feel safe—was gone. She ran through the house, checking his office, his car, the coat rack. Everything was there…except him.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next few hours blurred into a haze of fear. The police came to ask questions, neighbors whispered their worries, and Krystal’s stomach twisted with every ring of the phone that never brought answers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her mother clutched her hand tightly. “We’ll find him. We have to,” she whispered, but even she didn’t sound certain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Krystal remembered the little signs she had noticed over the past weeks—the secretive phone calls, the letters that didn’t belong, her father’s distracted glances out the window. Now it all made a cold, terrifying sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    By evening, her mother finally spoke, voice shaking. “Krystal… people have been watching us. Outside the house. We don’t know who they are or what they want. We can’t stay here anymore.” The words hit Krystal like ice. The house that had felt safe for eighteen years, the walls that held memories of laughter and warmth, suddenly felt like a trap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Boxes lined the living room as they packed quickly, each one filled with memories they couldn’t carry. Krystal moved mechanically, folding clothes, stuffing them in, her mind spinning. She paused at a family photograph, running her fingers over her dad’s face. “I hope we find him soon,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Night fell as they drove to the new city. Krystal stared out the window, the streets unfamiliar, every corner a reminder that her old life was gone. Her mother gripped the steering wheel tightly, glancing at every passing shadow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The silence in the car was heavy, broken only by the hum of the engine and the rustling of boxes. Krystal felt her hands tremble, hugging her backpack close. Fear, sadness, and uncertainty tangled together in her chest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the new house appeared. It was big, old, with paint peeling and an overgrown garden. The air smelled faintly of damp wood and dust. The house felt alive in a strange way, quiet but watching, as if it had been waiting for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Krystal stepped out of the car and walked to the front door. Every step echoed through the empty hallways as they entered. The furniture was covered in white sheets, and the air smelled of age and forgotten years. Her stomach twisted. The house was strange, odd, and lonely. And somehow…magnetic.
  </p>
  <p>
    As they unpacked that night, Krystal wandered from room to room, her fingers brushing over old furniture, walls, and windowsills. Nothing moved, but she felt…observed. Something was there, just out of sight. She didn’t understand it yet, but something told her: this house wasn’t ordinary. And her life was about to change in ways she couldn’t imagine.

  <h2>Chapter 6 — Moving Into Strangeness</h2>
  <p>
    The first morning in the new house was quiet. Too quiet.
    Krystal woke to the sound of distant wind rattling the windowpanes and the faint hum of the city far below. The walls seemed to hold a weight she couldn’t name, a strange hush that made her skin tingle. She got out of bed and stretched, looking around her new room.
    The furniture was old, polished in a dull shine, but nothing felt familiar. She opened her wardrobe. Her clothes smelled faintly of her old home, but the air in the room carried a strange chill. Something about this house whispered secrets she didn’t understand.
    Her mom called from the kitchen. “Breakfast is ready,” she said. Her voice carried the usual warmth, but even it sounded slightly off in the heavy morning air.
    Krystal went downstairs. The kitchen was functional, tidy, but the sunlight through the windows didn’t feel warm. It was cold, sharp, bouncing off the walls like it wanted to expose every corner of the house.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next few hours, Krystal and her mother unpacked. Her mother worked methodically, arranging plates, clearing cabinets, smoothing over wrinkles in tablecloths. Krystal wandered through the rooms, opening drawers, inspecting closets.
    At first, nothing seemed unusual. But small things started to make her pause.
    Her blanket, which she had tossed across the bed that morning, was now neatly folded. A stack of books she had set on her desk had been rearranged—alphabetical by title, though she was sure she hadn’t touched them. She frowned. “I must be imagining things,” she muttered.
    The lights flickered twice, once when she poured water into a glass, once when she passed the hallway. The air seemed cooler in places she hadn’t noticed before. And sometimes, when she glanced quickly toward a corner, she thought she saw shadows move just slightly, disappearing when she looked again.
  </p>
  <p>
    That afternoon, curiosity got the better of her. Krystal wandered into the attic. The stairs creaked under her weight, the air smelling of old wood and dust. Boxes lined the walls, old furniture draped in white sheets. The light from her flashlight swept across the room, illuminating forgotten objects—a cracked mirror, a stack of yellowed papers, a broken chair.
    She bent down to examine a small wooden box sitting on the floor. The wood was carved with strange symbols she didn’t recognize. Her fingers traced the edges. Nothing happened. She straightened up, brushing the dust from her jeans.
    Then, from the corner of her eye, she saw movement. Not a person, not an animal, but a shadow shifting where it shouldn’t. Her heart thumped. She spun around. Empty.
    Krystal exhaled slowly. “Just the wind,” she whispered, though she wasn’t sure if it was the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Days passed. Krystal noticed more gentle strangeness—books moving slightly on shelves, lights flickering when she passed, soft sounds like whispers at night, or the faint sensation that she was being watched, always gently, never threatening.
    She tried to tell herself it was nothing. The house was old. Old houses made noises. Old houses carried memories.
    But deep down, Krystal couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was alive. That it had noticed her. That something—or someone—was waiting for her to find it.
    And she felt a pull, small at first, tugging at her curiosity. Something in this house wanted her attention. Something that would change her life forever.

  <h2>Chapter 7 — The Thread In The Dark</h2>

  <p>
    Almost a month had passed since Krystal’s father went missing, but the ache hadn’t faded. If anything, it had settled into her chest so quietly that she felt it every time the house went silent.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new house didn’t help. It still didn’t feel like home. She and her mother had been living there for only a few weeks, but the place always felt cold, like it was waiting for something. Her mom had started her new job, leaving early every morning and returning late, and Krystal spent most days alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    That afternoon had been oddly heavy. Nothing bad happened — just the kind of day where every little thing reminded her of her father. The shelf he used to fix. The way he would call her name from the kitchen. His laugh. His stupid jokes.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of it came back in flashes.
  </p>

  <p>
    By evening, the emptiness got too loud, and Krystal found herself walking upstairs toward the attic again. She didn’t even know why she always ended up there. Maybe because it was the only place in the house where the silence felt a little different — like something was stored inside it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The attic door creaked when she pushed it open. The room was dim, lit only by a thin slice of early evening light coming through the broken window. Dust hung in the air as if the place had been waiting untouched for years.
  </p>

  <p>
    She moved around slowly this time, not rushing like before. Her eyes scanned old boxes, stacks of books, broken lamps… and then she saw it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A small wooden frame lying face-down near a pile of blankets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Krystal bent down and picked it up. It was heavier than she expected. She turned it over and squinted — the glass was covered in dust, making the picture inside almost impossible to see. All she could make out was the faint outline of a boy. Maybe her age. Maybe younger. She couldn’t tell.
  </p>

  <p>
    She rubbed the glass with her thumb, trying to wipe off the grime—
    And immediately felt a sharp sting.
  </p>

  <p>
    A tiny crack in the glass. Too small to notice in the dim light.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Ahh—”
  </p>

  <p>
    She pulled her hand back. A thin line of red welled up on her finger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before she could find something to wipe it with, a single drop of blood slid down her fingertip… and landed directly on the photo.
  </p>

  <p>
    It didn’t roll off.<br>
    It didn’t smear.<br>
    It soaked in.<br>
    Like the photo had been waiting for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Krystal froze.
  </p>

  <p>
    The attic seemed to hold its breath.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then everything happened at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lights in the attic flickered violently — once, twice — and then burst into darkness. The floor trembled. A low rumble echoed from outside as rain slammed against the roof, followed by a sharp crack of thunder that made her jump.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her heart pounded as she whirl around, clutching the photo frame.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then she felt it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pull on her wrist. Not painful. Not soft. Just… there.<br>
    Like someone had tied a thread between her and something behind her.
  </p>

  <p>
    She lifted her hand slowly.
  </p>

  <p>
    A thin golden line glowed on her wrist, bright enough to cut through the dark. It stretched outward into the shadows in front of her, connecting her to—
  </p>

  <p>
    A shape.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first it was just a faint outline, like smoke trying to become a person. But the more she stared, the clearer it became — the figure of a boy, standing still, taking form.
  </p>

  <p>
    The storm outside grew louder.<br>
    The attic felt colder.<br>
    And the golden thread pulsed once… twice…
  </p>

  <p>
    The boy suddenly gasped.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lights flickered back on.
  </p>

  <p>
    And Krystal saw him clearly.
  </p>

  <p>
    He looked real. Too real. His skin was pale, almost soft-looking. His hair was messy, falling slightly over his eyes. His expression was stunned, confused, scared — and he was staring right at her like she was the one who didn’t belong.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What—where—?” he whispered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Krystal stepped back, her grip tightening around the frame. Her breath hitched.
  </p>

  <p>
    He looked human. Completely. But something felt off — like the air around him wasn’t fully there.
  </p>

  <p>
    He blinked, panicked.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Where am I? What… what happened?” He touched his chest as if trying to feel a heartbeat that wasn’t there. “I—I only remember dying. And then… nothing. Just darkness. And that ritual.” His voice was trembling. “I saw it. The steps. And then suddenly—I woke up.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Her eyes widened.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Woke up?” she whispered.
  </p>

  <p>
    He shook his head quickly, looking even more confused.
  </p>

  <p>
    “No… not like a human wakes up. I’m not—alive.”
  </p>

  <p>
    His voice caught. “I think I’m a ghost.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Krystal felt her stomach drop.
  </p>

  <p>
    The golden thread between them flickered once — and then faded into invisibility, like it hid itself the moment they both noticed it.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the pull remained.
  </p>

  <p>
    He looked at her like he was waiting for her to say something — anything.

    <h2>CHAPTER 8 — Rules Of A Bond They Can't Break</h2>

    <p>For a long moment, neither of them moved.</p>
    <p>Krystal kept staring at the boy—no, the ghost—who looked just as scared as she felt. He wasn’t floating or glowing or doing anything ghost-like. He stood there like a confused stranger who woke up in the wrong place.</p>
    <p>The storm outside softened into steady rain, but the tension inside the attic didn’t fade.</p>
    <p>Krystal finally found her voice.</p>
    <p>“Are… are you really a ghost?”</p>
    <p>He swallowed, looking down at his hands like he expected them to disappear.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what else I could be,” he said quietly. “I don’t feel… alive. I don’t feel anything.” He touched the old furniture behind him; his fingers passed right through it. “See? I can’t even pick things up.”</p>
    <p>Krystal’s fear shifted into confusion.</p>
    <p>If he couldn’t touch anything, why could she see him so clearly? Why could she feel the pull on her wrist?</p>
    <p>The ghost took a small step toward her—but immediately stopped when Krystal flinched.</p>
    <p>“I won’t hurt you,” he said quickly, lifting both hands. “I don’t even know if I can hurt anyone.”</p>
    <p>She hesitated, then nodded. Slowly.</p>
    <p>“What do you remember?” she asked.</p>
    <p>He blinked, frowned, tried to think.</p>
    <p>“Only two things,” he said softly. “The moment I died… and the ritual.” He looked at her wrist, at the place where the golden thread had appeared. “I saw it happening in my head. I saw how it works. And that’s what woke me up.”</p>
    <p>Krystal’s stomach tightened.</p>
    <p>“And the… thread?”</p>
    <p>His eyes softened like he understood her fear.</p>
    <p>“It’s real,” he said. “Even if you can’t see it all the time.”</p>
    <p>He pointed at her wrist. “That thread binds us together. If you go too far away, something bad will happen. To both of us.”</p>
    <p>She immediately stepped back to test him—just to see.</p>
    <p>A sharp pain shot up her wrist like someone yanked a string inside her bones.</p>
    <p>She gasped and grabbed her arm.</p>
    <p>The ghost winced at the same time, clutching his chest. “Don’t— don’t do that. Please.” His voice cracked. “It hurts.”</p>
    <p>Krystal quickly stepped forward again, and the pain vanished like it was never there.</p>
    <p>Her heart pounded.</p>
    <p>“So it’s real. We really are… connected.”</p>
    <p>He nodded, looking defeated.</p>
    <p>“Please help me,” he said quietly, looking lost and sad. “I don’t want to stay like this forever.”</p>
    <p>Krystal didn’t know what she felt—fear, shock, disbelief—maybe all of them.</p>
    <p>But she saw how scared he was. How lost.</p>
    <p>And for a moment, she remembered how she felt when her father disappeared. Alone. Confused. Searching for something she couldn’t reach.</p>
    <p>So she straightened her shoulders and said, “Okay. We’ll… deal with this together. We’ll figure it out.”</p>
    <p>Relief washed over his face.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” he whispered shyly</p>

    <p>The rest of the night was awkward.</p>
    <p>Krystal brought him downstairs, and he followed her like a shadow—silent, careful, keeping distance, as if afraid he’d scare her again. Every time she stepped even slightly too far, they both felt a warning tug, so they stopped trying.</p>

    <p>They learned little things:</p>
    <p>He didn’t make footsteps.</p>
    <p>He didn’t breathe.</p>
    <p>He didn’t blink unless he remembered to.</p>

    <p>He sat on the floor while she sat on her bed, both unsure what to do next.</p>
    <p>“You can stay there,” Krystal said, pointing to the far wall.</p>
    <p>“Trust me, I’m fine here,” he said immediately and even scooted further away.</p>
    <p>She lay down eventually, exhausted and overwhelmed.</p>
    <p>The ghost spoke quietly from the corner.</p>
    <p>“I won’t do anything. You can sleep.”</p>
    <p>His voice sounded sincere. Scared, even.</p>

    <p>Morning came slowly.</p>
    <p>Krystal woke up to sunlight… and the ghost sitting quietly by her window, staring outside like he’d been watching the world wake up without him.</p>

    <p>Neither spoke much that day.</p>
    <p>Krystal filled out college applications on her laptop. The ghost stayed near the window, almost like the outside world calmed him. Whenever she got up to get water, he followed silently but sat far away so she wouldn’t feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>They spent the entire day like that—near each other but not talking, both trying to accept this strange new reality.</p>

    <p>In the evening, Krystal decided to go upstairs to the terrace for fresh air and the ghost followed her.</p>
    <p>They sat together on the terrace floor, the cool breeze brushing past them. The distance limit tugged just enough to remind them of the invisible thread, the bond neither of them asked for.</p>

<div class="page" id="ch9">
    <h2>CHAPTER 9 — NAMES, QUESTIONS, AND TRUTHS</h2>
    <p>Krystal sat on her bed, legs curled up, glancing at the ghost, who was sitting on the floor. The room was quiet, with only the soft hum of the city outside. The air felt heavy with curiosity and uncertainty.</p>

    <p>“Before we… talk properly,” Krystal said, hesitating, “we should probably call each other by our names. It’s easier than saying… ‘you.’”</p>

    <p>The ghost’s gaze was uncertain. “I don’t remember my name.”</p>

    <p>Krystal smiled faintly. “Then I’ll give you one. Kai.”</p>

    <p>Kai repeated it slowly, testing the sound. “Kai…” In that instant, a thin golden thread pulsed faintly around her wrist, visible only for a heartbeat before fading away. It left behind a quiet sense of connection she could feel even without seeing it.</p>

    <p>“And you?” he asked.</p>

    <p>“Krys,” she said. “Just a nickname. Makes things easier.”</p>

    <p>Kai nodded slowly. “Krys…” The word lingered in the room, soft and almost comforting.</p>

    <p>Krystal leaned back, curiosity pressing forward. “Kai… the things that have been happening around the house—the books moving, the blankets folded, the curtains closing… the shadows I kept seeing… was that you?”</p>

    <p>Kai shook his head. “No. I haven’t done any of that. Maybe… it’s the ritual. Its energy can move things, make the house react. But it’s not me.”</p>

    <p>Krystal frowned. “So it’s the ritual, not you.”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Kai said quietly. “I’m bound to you. I can’t control it. It sometimes moves on its own, even I can’t fully understand it.”</p>

    <p>Krystal exhaled slowly. “Then… tell me more.”</p>

    <p>Kai’s voice became distant, almost like he was recalling something written into him rather than remembered. “The Thread of Fate senses someone capable… strong enough to guide it, to help me survive until my unfinished business is resolved. That’s you, Krys. You were chosen because of who you are, even if you didn’t know it yet.”</p>

    <p>Krystal’s chest tightened. “So it wasn’t just accidental?”</p>

    <p>“No,” Kai said firmly. “The ritual needed a living anchor. Someone willing to bear the connection and its risks. That’s you. My survival, my chance at peace… depends on you.”</p>

    <p>She nodded, feeling the weight of his words. Silence stretched between them for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then, trying to break the tension, Krystal said, “Okay… let’s do a Q&amp;A. I ask, you answer. Then you ask, I answer. It’ll help us… understand each other.”</p>

    <p>Kai tilted his head, curious. “Q&amp;A?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” she said, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I need to know you. And maybe you need to know me too.”</p>

    <p>Kai nodded. “Okay… we can try.”</p>

    <p>Krystal leaned forward, fidgeting slightly. “First… do you remember anything about your past? Family? Friends?”</p>

    <p>Kai shook his head. “No… only fragments. The ritual, my last moments… but nothing before that. I don’t even know my own name.”</p>

    <p>Krystal bit her lip. “Alright… do you… sleep? Eat? Do normal human things?”</p>

    <p>Kai thought for a moment. “I… I remember faintly. I could… when I was alive. But now… I cannot. Not really. I’m… different.”</p>

    <p>Kai hesitated, then said, “Krys…. Can you tell me… about your life? Friends, family?”</p>

    <p>Krystal smiled faintly, her heart heavy. “Well… my dad went missing almost a month ago. That’s why we moved here. Mom’s trying to adjust, starting a new job, and I’m mostly on my own. Friends from school… they’re drifting away. I’ve been feeling… lonely.”</p>

    <p>Kai’s gaze softened. “Lonely… like me, now. But… you are strong. Caring. That’s why the ritual chose you, Krys.”</p>

    <p>Krystal felt a strange warmth at his words. “Thanks… Kai.”</p>

    <p>Just as she began to feel a little comforted, a faint draft swept through the room. The lights flickered for a second, and the faintest shadow moved at the corner of her vision. For an instant, the golden thread pulsed again around her wrist, sharp and tense.</p>

    <p>“Krys… that… isn’t me,” Kai said, his voice low and cautious.</p>

    <p>Krystal’s heart jumped. Whoever—or whatever—was moving in the house, it was close.</p>

    <p>And it was watching them.</p>

<div class="page" id="ch10">
    <h2>CHAPTER 10 — Threads Of Support</h2>
    <p>Krystal sat cross-legged on her bedroom floor, surrounded by a sea of college brochures, notebooks, and a tangle of pencils. Her brow was furrowed, tapping her pencil nervously against the desk. Arts. Creative writing. Theater. Graphic design. Each option seemed so far from the girl everyone called “strong” and “brave.”</p>

    <p>Kai perched nearby, knees tucked under his chin, watching her quietly. His dark eyes followed her every movement, sharp but gentle, noticing her small sighs, the slight tremor in her hands, the way her lips pressed together when doubt crept in.</p>

    <p>“You’ve been staring at that brochure for an hour,” he said softly. “Are you… stuck?”</p>

    <p>Krystal shook her head. “I think… I want something different. Something… creative. But I don’t know if I’m… capable.”</p>

    <p>Kai leaned a little closer. “You are. Strong or brave doesn’t mean you can’t… create. You just… haven’t given yourself permission yet.” His voice was calm, patient, encouraging, as if he already knew she could do it.</p>

    <p>Krystal exhaled, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Thanks… Kai. It’s just… scary. Feeling… delicate when you’re supposed to be tough.”</p>

    <p>He tilted his head, eyes soft. “You can be brave… and delicate. You don’t have to choose one.”</p>

    <p>For the next week, they prepared together, every evening. Krystal would sit at her desk, notebook open, while Kai hovered nearby, occasionally sitting on the floor. Each night, she read questions aloud, practiced answers, and Kai listened, giving quiet feedback.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, she faltered—mispronouncing a word or losing her train of thought. At first, she would blush, panicked, thinking his presence would make her mess up. But Kai’s subtle encouragement kept her grounded. A soft nod, a whisper of, “You’ve got this,” or even a gentle hand hovering near hers gave her courage.</p>

    <p>By the third day, Kai had discovered something new: when she answered a question correctly, he could make little things happen—small celebrations that felt private, magical, and comforting.</p>

    <p>The first time he tried, Krystal had finished a tough mock essay. She looked up, exhausted, and Kai’s hands rose slightly. From the ceiling, tiny blossoms floated down, petals brushing her hair and notebook. She blinked in surprise.</p>

    <p>“Flowers?” she laughed, brushing a petal away.</p>

    <p>Kai’s cheeks flushed faintly. “You… did really well. I… thought it should feel special.”</p>

    <p>Krystal smiled through her tiredness, feeling a warmth she hadn’t felt in weeks. “Thank you… Kai. That… that makes it easier.”</p>

    <p>Other nights, when memories overwhelmed her—the nights her father stayed up making coffee while she studied, waiting until she finally drifted off—she would bite her lip, tears welling. Kai would notice instantly.</p>

    <p>A small shimmer in the corner of the room. A faint, warm glow. A soft touch of light or a small breeze carrying the scent of something comforting, like home. Not enough to be shocking or frightening—just enough to remind her she wasn’t alone.</p>

    <p>“Dad…. Dad would be proud of me, right?” she whispered one night, voice trembling.</p>

    <p>Kai settled closer, eyes soft but firm. “I am sure he would be after all who wouldn’t feel proud, seeing their daughter working hard. Also you’re… already giving your best and that is all that matters. And I’m… here. Every step.”</p>

    <p>Krystal let herself lean on him, a rare moment of vulnerability, feeling less lonely than she had in months.</p>

    <p>Finally, the night before the interview, Krystal made her decision. Creative arts. She felt a flutter of fear—everything about it was new—but also excitement.</p>

    <p>Kai’s eyes glimmered. “It… suits you. Because it’s you. Not because it’s easy… but because it lets you… feel. And you… feel a lot. You’ll do great.”</p>

    <p>Krystal hugged the brochure to her chest. “Thanks, Kai. For… being here.”</p>

    <p>“I’ll always be,” he said softly, a faint smile tugging at his lips.</p>

    <p>The morning of the interview, Krystal walked into the college, Kai walking quietly by her side. Her nerves tried to take over, but she glanced at him, and the world softened.</p>

    <p>During the interview, when she hesitated or stumbled, Kai’s subtle signals—head tilts, gentle nods, gentle smiles—kept her grounded.</p>

    <p>By the end, her confidence felt natural—not because she was perfect, but because Kai was there, believing in her, celebrating her, keeping her steady.</p>

    <p>Later that evening, Krystal opened the email:</p>

    <p>“Congratulations! You have been accepted into the Creative Arts program…”</p>

    <p>Her chest tightened. She looked at Kai. His eyes were wide, dark, warm, shining with pride and quiet joy.</p>

    <p>“We… did it,” she whispered.</p>

    <p>Kai’s shy smile was all the answer she needed. “No… you did it. I… I just… was here.”</p>

    <p>Krystal laughed through her tears. “Kai… you were more than here. You… made me feel like I wasn’t alone.”</p>

    <p>He ducked his head, cheeks faintly pink, but his eyes never left hers. “Good… I… I wanted to. Always.”</p>

    <p>Krystal realized something profound: with Kai, she wasn’t lonely anymore. She had a companion, a friend, a confidant, and a silent cheerleader for every victory—small or big. College would start in a week, and she was ready, not because she was fearless, but because she had someone by her side who made her brave in the quietest, most heartfelt way.</p>

    “Some support doesn’t roar. It whispers. It celebrates quietly. And in that gentle presence, loneliness fades, courage blooms, and even the smallest victories feel like magic.”</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 11 — FIRST STEPS, NEW BEGINNINGS</h2>
  <p>The morning sun streamed through the sheer curtains, painting soft stripes across Krystal’s bedroom floor. Her packed bag lay next to her, filled with sketchbooks, pencils, and the few items she considered essential. College was starting today, and her heart was a mix of excitement and nerves.</p>
  <p>Kai hovered near the window, arms crossed loosely, eyes tracing her movements. His usually calm expression was slightly anxious—subtle signs of him adjusting to this new, busier world.</p>
  <p>“You… ready?” he asked, his voice quiet but steady.</p>
  <p>Krystal exhaled, running a hand through her hair. “I think so. I… I just hope I can… fit in.”</p>
  <p>Kai tilted his head, his dark eyes gentle. “You… will. People notice things… the way you… see the world. You… just have to… be yourself.”</p>
  <p>Krystal smiled faintly. “I hope so. I don’t want to feel… lonely again.”</p>
  <p>Kai’s soft glow pulsed faintly around him—a little encouragement. “You… won’t. Not while I’m here.”</p>
  <p>First Lecture</p>
  <p>Her first class was Introduction to Creative Arts. The room smelled faintly of paint and fresh paper. She found a seat near the middle, sketchbook ready.</p>
  <p>Kai sat beside her, on the empty seat, close enough for her to sense his presence. As the professor spoke, Krystal realized that she was absorbing the information differently—more openly, more curiously. Kai’s quiet, steady presence made her feel like she could explore, make mistakes, and still feel safe.</p>
  <p>When the professor asked her to introduce herself and share her creative goals, Krystal felt her throat tighten. Her mind raced. What if she sounded awkward? What if she embarrassed herself?</p>
  <p>Kai’s warm glow brushed against her wrist subtly, almost like a gentle nudge. She inhaled, looked at him, and then turned back to the class.</p>
  <p>“I… I want to explore how art can tell stories—stories of people, of emotions… things we don’t always say out loud,” she said. Her voice shook at first, then steadied.</p>
  <p>A few students nodded. One smiled. And Kai’s faint, proud glow made her heart feel lighter.</p>
  <p>Lunch and Small Discoveries</p>
  <p>During lunch, Krystal found a quiet spot under a tree with her sketchbook. She watched students around her laughing, sharing food, or flipping through portfolios.</p>
  <p>Kai perched on the bench beside her, tilting his head at her sketches. “You… you’ve got… a good eye,” he said softly. “I… I can see… the details you notice.”</p>
  <p>Krystal smiled, a blush rising. “Thanks… it helps having someone… who notices.”</p>
  <p>Kai’s golden glow shimmered faintly. “I… always notice. Especially you.”</p>
  <p>For the first time, Krystal realized how natural it felt to have someone quietly care, someone who could make her feel seen without saying too much. She sketched him, carefully, capturing the shy smile and the intensity in his dark eyes.</p>
  <p>“You… really think people will… understand me?” she asked, half to herself.</p>
  <p>Kai’s gaze softened. “They… will. They might not… all of them. But… the right ones… will.”</p>
  <p>Evening Reflections</p>
  <p>That evening, Krystal sat in her room, sketching quietly. Kai hovered nearby, hands clasped, watching her.</p>
  <p>“You… changed things for me,” she admitted softly. “I… felt lonely, unsure… even scared sometimes. But now… I feel… like I have someone who… really sees me.”</p>
  <p>Kai tilted his head, faint pink tint on his cheeks. “I… I just… wanted… to be here. To… help. I… care. You… you’re… not alone.”</p>
  <p>Krystal smiled, finally at ease. “Thanks… Kai. For everything.”</p>
  <p>He gave a small, shy nod. “Always.”</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 12 — A WEEK OF QUIET CHANGES</h2>
  <p>By the time the sun rose on her second day of college, Krystal already felt the tiny shift happening inside her—like she was standing between her old life and the new one, still unsure of which direction felt more real.</p>
  <p>Kai walked beside her as she walked down the street toward campus. He looked around nervously at the passing bikes, honking cars, and chattering students—even though none of them could see him. His hair fell slightly into his eyes, and he kept brushing it away shyly out of habit.</p>
  <p>“You walk… pretty fast,” he muttered as he drifted closer, as if afraid he’d get left behind.</p>
  <p>Krystal smirked. “You are a ghost. Speed shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
  <p>Kai’s cheeks turned faintly pink. “Still… I don’t want to lose you in a crowd.”</p>
  <p>Her chest warmed at the quiet honesty in his voice.</p>
  <p>By mid-week, a routine began forming. Morning classes, afternoon creative labs, a short walk home. But everything felt different now—not lighter, not easier, just… less lonely.</p>
  <p>Every room she entered now had two occupants: her, and the quiet ghost who panicked at ceiling fans, flinched at pigeons too close to his face, and yet somehow managed to be the bravest presence she knew.</p>
  <p>Whenever the work overwhelmed her, Kai noticed before she spoke.</p>
  <p>On Wednesday, she sat in the studio, staring at a blank page. Everyone else already started sketching. The ticking clock felt painfully loud. Her fingers trembled.</p>
  <p>Kai came a little closer gently. “You don’t have to impress anyone,” he whispered. “Just… draw what you feel. Even if it’s messy.”</p>
  <p>Krystal swallowed, exhaling slowly. “I feel like I don’t belong here.”</p>
  <p>Kai shook his head, eyes wide with soft urgency. “You belong because you want to. And wanting is enough. Let the rest come later.”</p>
  <p>She picked up the pencil. A soft shimmer—barely there—brushed her hand as she made the first stroke.</p>
  <p>Thursday evening brought the first real break. They sat on the balcony floor, Krystal with her knees pulled up, Kai beside her.</p>
  <p>She flipped through her sketchbook. “I think I want to specialize in mixed arts,” she murmured.</p>
  <p>“It’s rough around the edges… I’m rough too. So maybe it fits.” Kai nodded thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>“It fits because it lets you tell the truth. You’re strong, but not in a loud way. And mixed arts… lets both parts of you exist.”</p>
  <p>She blinked slowly. “Both parts?”</p>
  <p>Kai looked down, shy. “The tough part… and the one that feels alone sometimes.”</p>
  <p>Her throat tightened—not painfully, but like something was finally loosening.</p>
  <p>There were moments when she broke. Like Friday night, when a class assignment reminded her of late-night study sessions with her father.</p>
  <p>“How am I supposed to go home to show him anything now?” she whispered, fingers digging into her palm.</p>
  <p>“He used to sit beside me… even when I barely spoke.”</p>
  <p>Kai’s expression softened into something fragile, something that made him look both young and ancient. He moved closer, barely an inch, careful not to startle her.</p>
  <p>A warm glow surrounded them—faint, gentle—as if the air itself understood her grief. “You don’t have to stop missing him,” Kai said quietly. “And you don’t have to pretend you’re okay with it. I… I can sit with you now. Until you sleep. If you want.”</p>
  <p>Tears spilled down her cheek. She didn’t say yes. She didn’t need to. He stayed.</p>
  <p>On Saturday, something magical happened. Krystal completed a full practice assignment. She didn’t think it was perfect, but it was hers.</p>
  <p>Kai hovered behind her chair, peeking at the paper like a nervous child looking at exam results. And then—almost on instinct—he lifted his hands slightly. Tiny soft petals drifted from nowhere, landing on her finished page.</p>
  <p>Krystal laughed, a sound she hadn’t heard from herself in months. “You and your flower thing,” she teased.</p>
  <p>Kai’s face went bright red. “I… I just wanted it to feel special. You worked so hard.”</p>
  <p>“It does feel special,” she said, meeting his eyes. “Because you’re here.”</p>
  <p>He froze. Then gave the smallest, shyest smile she had ever seen.</p>
  <p>By Sunday night, she realized something. She wasn’t scared of Monday. Not anymore. This new life… with all its questions and pressure and fear… wasn’t crushing her. Because she wasn’t facing it alone.</p>
  <p>Kai hovered in her doorway, holding the now permanently borrowed pillow under one arm. “Ready for week two?” he asked, trying to sound brave even though she could clearly see he was the nervous one.</p>
  <p>Krystal slid her bag onto the chair and grinned softly. “Yeah. I think… I finally am.”</p>
  <p>Kai’s smile lit up his whole face. And for the first time in a long time, Krystal slept without feeling the emptiness beside her.</p>
